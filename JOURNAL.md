## 11/2/2025 - Block Diagram  

## Day-1
### Prepared block diagram

Did research about parts. I have chosen nRF52840 for power efficiency and easy coding. Also I will add a decent battery. I will give it a nice 3D printed case for protection.

This is the block diagram explaining the functionality.
